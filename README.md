# LI 04 ... Succeeding In Web Development
## 2020 11 20 : 1300 | Begin and Complete
This is a class that explains all the parts of becomeing a Web Dev and what one should be able to do and provide the community.  I need to rewatch this and take extensive notes.  The instructor listed off a ton of resources.  It would be easy to flail and try to do and know everything AT ONCE

## 2020 11 20 : 1500 | Begin Lesson
I started this lesson because it works well with AMU's Web Dev Intro Week 04 assignment.  I expect I will learn more than I need for the class.  Still, that is what I'm looking for.  Completed.

## 2020 11 24 : 1500 | Start & Finish Lesson
I started this lesson because it works well with Week 05's Wev Dev Lesson in AMU.  However, the instructor was so terribly sad I just finished the lesson for the cert.  I'll be using reference because things can change.  Also, this lesson was kind of old.  She did stuff that didn't make sense.
